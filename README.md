# Datastructures Re-Implemented in Javascript
This is the repository for a series I'm writing on Medium going over different data structures re-implemented in raw JS.  
There are so many structures you get "for free" in Javascript and other modern langauges that self-taught devs (like myself) don't usually NEED to peek under the hood.
But it's worth doing, and worth learning.
